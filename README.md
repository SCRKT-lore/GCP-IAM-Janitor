## 🔑 Authentication Setup

### Application Default Credentials (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Required Permissions

Your authenticated account needs the following IAM permissions:

**For Project Analysis:**
- `resourcemanager.projects.get`
- `resourcemanager.projects.list` 
- `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy`

**For Organization Analysis:**
- `resourcemanager.organizations.get`
- `resourcemanager.organizations.list`
- `resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy`
- `resourcemanager.folders.list`
- `resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy`

**For Role Analysis:**
- `iam.roles.list`
- `iam.roles.get`

**Recommended Roles:**
- `Security Reviewer` (roles/iam.securityReviewer)
- `Organization Viewer` (roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer)
- `Project Viewer` (roles/viewer) on target projects

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
```
AuthenticationError: Application Default Credentials not found
```
Solution: Run `gcloud auth application-default login`

**Permission Denied**
```
PermissionDenied: User does not have permission to access project
```
Solution: Ensure your account has the required IAM permissions listed above

**No Data Loading**
```
No IAM data available. Please select resources...
```
Solution: Select at least one project or organization in the sidebar filters

**Performance Issues**
- Clear cache using the sidebar button
- Reduce the number of selected projects
- Check your network connection to GCP APIs

**Select All Button Not Working**
If the "Select All" button doesn't seem to select projects:
- This has been fixed in the latest version
- Ensure you're using the latest code
- The button now properly updates the multiselect widget

**Plotly Visualization Errors**
```
ValueError: Invalid property specified for object of type plotly.graph_objs.Layout
```
Solution: This has been resolved in the current version with updated Plotly syntax

### Logging

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
streamlit run app.py
```

View logs in the terminal where you ran the application.
