**For Organization Analysis:**
- `resourcemanager.organizations.get`
- `resourcemanager.organizations.list`
- `resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy`
- `resourcemanager.folders.list`
- `resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy`

**For Role Analysis:**
- `iam.roles.list`
- `iam.roles.get`

**Recommended Roles:**
- `Security Reviewer` (roles/iam.securityReviewer)
- `Organization Viewer` (roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer)

### 🔧 Configuration for Advanced Features

#### Cloud Identity API Setup (Optional)
For enhanced identity analysis with group membership resolution:

1. **Enable Cloud Identity API:**
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable cloudidentity.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Set up domain-wide delegation** (for Google Workspace customers):
   - Follow Google's [domain-wide delegation guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority)
   - Grant necessary scopes for Cloud Identity API

#### Audit Logging Configuration
For comprehensive audit trail analysis:

1. **Ensure audit logs are enabled:**
   ```bash
   # Check current audit configuration
   gcloud logging sinks list
   
   # Verify admin activity logs are enabled (should be by default)
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID --format="json" | grep auditConfigs
   ```

2. **Recommended log retention:**
   - Set appropriate log retention periods for compliance requirements
   - Consider using log exports to BigQuery for long-term analysis
